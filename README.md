## 📦 Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Project
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Raafiya-Gouher/Git-Workflow-Automation-Using-Interactive-Shell-Scripts.git
cd Git-Workflow-Automation-Using-Interactive-Shell-Scripts
```

### 2. Make scripts executable

```
chmod +x interactive_git_automation.sh
chmod +x test_git_automation.sh
```


### 3. Run the test script
```
./test_git_automation.sh
```

You will be prompted to:

* Enter a GitHub repository name

* Provide branch names

* Choose to include a README or not

* Set visibility (public/private)

* Authenticate via GitHub CLI (first-time only)
  
  
## 📄 What Gets Created

* A new Git repo under the given name

* A file called version.txt that tracks:
```
Version: 1.0.0 (main)
Version: 1.0.1 (feature-login)
Version: 1.0.2 (bugfix-api)
```
* A README (if opted in)
* Separate commits on each branch with version updates

* All changes pushed to a new GitHub repo

### 🧪 Testing Workflow

After running the main script, you can test by:

- Viewing branches in GitHub

- Opening and reading ``` version.txt ```

- Verifying commit history with:
  ```
  git log --oneline --graph --all
  ```

## 🧪 Sample Output

* Enter your GitHub repository name: ```Git-Workflow-Automation-Using-Interactive-Shell-Scripts```
* Enter the number of additional branches: ```2```
* Enter name for branch #1: ```feature1```
* Enter name for branch #2: ```feature2```
* Do you want to include a README.md file? (yes/no): ```yes```
* Should the GitHub repo be public or private? (public/private): ```public```
